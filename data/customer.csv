Challenges:

1. The way subs are versioned for every change -  Even with a small update on a custom field in the contract, Ordway creates a new version. This makes tracking actual changes very difficult. Their use case calls for updates to Sub objects very often and this increases the historicals on a contract which they feel is unnecessary.

2. The way contracts are marked canceled - They send usages to contracts but when a contract is in Cancelled status (as of a future date) it becomes difficult for them to send in the usages because their code excludes canceled contracts to avoid adding usages to truly canceled contract.

3. $0 invoices - They are concerned that as the $0 invoices increase this will trigger nexus and in certain states which go by transaction volume they will end up qualifying to pay for taxes by the total volume of invoices created even though they are not technically in the bracket 

Revenue issues for Usages - Revenue keeps changing for usage charges, Deepgram to share examples and followed up for the same but nothing shared yet","","","","","C-00130","","","","","0.00","0.00","Green","","0.00","","Live - Support"

	<li>The client is now invoicing out of Ordway</li>
	<li>They loaded usages for the month of June via API.</li>
	<li>They came up with new requirements/changes in the logic for the invoice templates, and Raquel is making the changes.</li>
	<li>The client came with the new requirement on min commitment WF to include a partial month if the status of the sub is renewal, discussion scheduled on 7/12</li>
	<li>Usage records in the invoice template is only fetching  less than 50 records this is a limitation on usages and orders object, Raquel flagged this issue as the client reported usages missing in the invoices.</li>
	<li>https://ordwaylabs.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/11292</li>
	<li>As per the internal discussion with engg, provided 3 options to clients and client opted the immediate option as to increase the usage record size to 100 invoice lines and the next option is an enhacement that product team to takeup. </li>
	<li>Risks flagged in the internal channel to the team, isk factor to be considered in few months they would be over limit, so any enhancement needs to be assessed and if not on product roadmap we need to communicate back to client,to avoid situation of not being able to create an invoice</li>
	<li>For now the pending two invoices for their big customers are unblocked but we need this requirement to be considered so they are not blocked to generate invoices in Ordway.</li>
	<li>QBO too many failed errors post analysis resulted into issues where client has added manual credit to wrong accounts, details shared with the client to get this corrected, client will work with their accounting partners and let us know, no issues at Ordway end its on client to get this fixed. </li>
	<li>Reached out to engg to confirm the avg exchange rate delivery date if it will be delivered last week of July as promised waiitng for response. </li>
	<li>Mid Month Renewals: Context: Both the workflows built for them will not run if the subscription is not a full month based on their business process, Vijay recommended the below option to the client and email was sent on 7/20 to the client regarding the same.</li>
	<li><em>The best option for the mid-month renewals is to create the contracts so that they renew on the 1st of the month.<br />
	A custom field will become a maintenance overhead every time you have a new mid-month customer and it will add a complication in the WF that will slow it down.</em></li>
	<li>8/3: Client responded their accounting team agreed based on the JE errors resolution we provided, they have now turned off the sync for RealizedFXGainLoss, they have disabled this in Ordway integration now.</li>
	<li>No major issues reported by the client for Aug billing apart from two invoice minor template issues and one WF issue which was addressed by Vijay immediately.</li>
	<li>They now came up with many new questions on QBO which they never earlier along with changes to the invoicing templates </li>
	<li>Average exchange rate to be bought into Looker, ETA: scheduled to be released in a hotfix on Monday ( 8/7)</li>
	<li>8/5, email from Will confirming change in point of contacts at Flip rather than Romana it will be Will and Sam ( Co Founder ) </li>
	<li>Responded back to their QBO queries and also sent times for discussion as requested due to Romana being no more their primary point of contact. </li>
	<li>Meeting was scheduled with Will who reached out to us being the new POC and expecations were set, they had no clear internal handover when Romana departed and they have no knowledge on the implementation,setup and the business process that were agreed upon, we shared all the relevant documentations enrolled them on university, provided sandbox access and clarified all their doubts setup another follow up call.</li>
	<li>Ordway Engineering team deployed average exchange rate into Looker, testing inprogress to ensure the reporting data is accurate.</li>

""We've met internally and will definitely be moving forward with getting the net-new, subscription-based iconik customers onto Ordway.

We're considering bringing over only the 3 new subscription products and leaving the existing usage-based customers on our homegrown solution. They owe us a product list and then we probably need another call to estimate LOE and see if we need to charge PS for this implementation. Since it's just net new it might be completed in a single call.

Celtx is almost entirely B2C and works fine on Stripe. I don't anticipate moving it onto Ordway. 

Wildmoka is low volume, high deal size. Any change to billing for those customers could be extremely disruptive, so we need to come up with a plan sometime in 2025.","","","","","C-00143","","","","","0.00","0.00","Green","","0.00","","Partially Live"

Workflow needed to  apply discounts based on volume.

some questions aroudn ordway being able to process/handle millions of usages each month. - we're asking them to send usage once per month at the end of the month which wont be an issue. If they send daily then Ordway would have to potentially delete the old usage and create new usage becaues the usage might need to get moved to a different charge (which is what we want to avoid).

confusion around mapping the data from their DB to Ordway.

They need their usage (camera info) to go to the correct subcharge and they agreed during sales cycle to do this calculation on their side before sending over the data. On the call last week they made a big deal about this that they don't want to do that but they agreed to look internally to see if they could. Project is definitely a bit at risk but pushing to have them continue.","","","","","C-00178","","","","","0.00","0.00","Green","","0.00","","Implementing"

Should we figure out how to get executive level audience to discuss strategy on the product? They recently raised $70M. Their initial structure was two subscriptions per customer and the charges were defined between the sponsor and participant. In Dec 2020, they wanted to combine all charges into one subscription, driven by salesforce, because there would/be only one opportunity in Salesforce. We moved the custom field and we did a data migration (import usage monthly, invoice quarterly). They have custom fields at the customer level. The custom fields help delineate invoices as some that are sent out some are not.","","Sneha currently working with OPS to run script quarterly to pull invoice PDFs in draft status.","","","US","","C-00010","","","Tier 1","","1762112.08","3237887.92","Green","49","5000000.00","","Live - Support"

Recently saw an email come through where someone on their side said ""Ordway is not the long term"" and we followed up with Jason. He said they love ordway and it has gone super smooth and thats why the other group is looking at it. 
from Jason: ""There's lots of internal discussions and push and pull right now. Accounting wants to move to Oracle for all orgs in the company, and different billing teams want to move to Ordway for the functionality benefits. As of now there's a large gap between Oracle and Ordway capabilities. So that's the give and take discussions. And I don't know where anything is going to end up at this point. But expect nothing to change any time soon. 

Things have absolutely gone great with Ordway and many people in the company are aware. That's why other teams are inquiring about Ordway. So there's no current complaints about gaps and everyone on the Heartland team has been happy with our go-live.

Revenue schedule without JEs: Please navigate to the Revenue Report and go into Additional Filters and select ""posted"" and condition as ""false"". Max has created a custom report for the same and shared it with you. 4. Display Subs: Based on the earliest first and oldest below that - We will loop in our product team about this and get back to you when we have an update on this. 5. Set up a time to go through the process of setting up a different revenue rule (currently there are one-time charges which have revenue schedules that are spread over). Let us know a good time for you to go through this in the next few months. Have been utilizing the platform to the ""fullest"" via API driven creation of customers, subscriptions, etc - few points of optimization: - Still currently exporting JEs from Ordway and importing into QB, likely will not change due to the nature of Ordway's QB integration - Workflow to potentially add the contact emails (they're primary source of truth when investigating accounts) to the customer level to allow for more easily accessible filtering - Customer portal to allow for students to keep track of their invoices. Currently they have certain invoices that are just strictly internal use only and do not want those present on the customer portal. We're releasing a feature in early Q2 to allow for more control over what can be shown in the customer portal","","Started using Affirm once we built it but Affirm told Fullstack they cannot support Affirm anymore and are looking for alternative solutions (2/10/25)

REPORTING
They have not fully moved to analytics because on the classic reports building a custom report is easier. Upon selecting the object on the new custom report the fields associated with the object get pre-selected and displayed. Whereas on the analytics when creating a custom report the user has to select the various dimensions manually, none of the fields get displayed automatically. In cases where the users are not aware of exactly which fields are present under which dimension it comes very complicated process.  

PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS 
1. Revenue recognition for FMV: Set up a call next week to walk through the exact requirements. This is not an immediate need but a long-term one so revenue can be used.

2. Netsuite/ QBO payments: Non-Stripe payments recorded on NS (direct deposits, check payments etc.) are not mapped back to Ordway. Are we planning to implement this soon for the others, NS and QBO?

He says Netsuite is better than QBO and thinks it will be almost the same price if not cheaper to get out of QBO + Ordway and move fully to Netsuite.

2. The manual syncing of revenue from Ordway to QBO that takes a lot of effort. They do not have the Rev JE sync enabled from Ord to QBO because revenue on Ordway is incorrect. One of the products - Creator Fees - They do not want to show revenue for this but it shows up on rev rec on Ord which is why they modify revenue manually every month before moving it from Ordway to QBO.","","","US","","C-00064","","","Tier 3","","-36933174.96","56933174.96","Yellow","297","20000000.00","","Churning"

Having invested thereafter in training to prevent user errors (which played a part in the September billing run issues), as well as a dry run of October billing, we had planned on the October billing run being smoother. However a combination of API based issues (from backdating charges) and our workflow creating duplicate lines (still pending RC), the October billing run was problematic, but was resolved by Day 5.

Contracts with Deferred Term Start Date (this is the 1 main issue because 'pending' RS doesn't show the amount that will be recognized - The Recurring Revenue Schedule is pending;  The Custom Revenue Recognition Dates Feature is not available. 
Example: Bullymake: Contract Effective Date: 12/20/24; Term Start Date: the earlier of Go-live date or 6/1/25
Ideal solution: A feature that allows us to have a placeholder for temporary revenue recognition period in order to forecast revenue

2. Forecast revenue - want to be able to see future revenue assuming subscriptions renew

3. Forecast billing - same as above for billing schedules

4. ARR Reporting - want to report ARR based on ""order date"" but we only have contract effective, service start, and billing start as options

5. Churn reporting - if a sub ends on the last day of the month Ordway counts the churn the following month but they want to count it in the month the contract ends. Same as some other client requests

I have summarised their comments below. Allyson is moving out of the team and Micheal and Melisa are the ones who are going to be using Ordway more. Generic Feedback: Unhappy with what was promised through the sales cycle and what was actually offered. Unhappy with the support experience. Allyson feels she acts as a product manager for Ordway to find bugs and is helping Ordway fix the issue. Specific product Issues: Refund issued in QBO not syncing with Ordway - Kaitlin is working closely on it (though the solution is 100% not working) would not be live up until Jan 2023. Credits created are not updating TCV and the revenue schedule - Requested ETA for a solution for this requirement. Few subscriptions on renewal creates erroneous revenue recognition for each version ( Yet to identify which are those subscriptions) QBO and Avalara sync is not trustworthy and have enabled webhooks to monitor the sync. Hubspot sync doesn't work thus cannot trust the reporting. UX and UI experience is not upto the mark. Custom reporting freezes most of the time ( Even after applying all the filters to narrow down the search. Followup : Expecting a call with the product team next week to understand where we stand on all of the above issues. Setup monthly cadence with CSM to help them get better usage out of Ordway. Call with Max to discuss Invoice volume processed out of Ordway plus Tier adjustment and to convey their feedback.","2021-12-21","","","","US","","C-00089","","","Tier 3","","14432608.29","5567391.71","Green","390","20000000.00","","Live - Support"
